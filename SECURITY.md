## Security Best Practices

When using `@dcyfr/ai-code-gen` in your projects:

### ✅ DO
- **Keep dependencies updated:** Regularly run `npm update @dcyfr/ai-code-gen`
- **Validate generated code:** Always review AI-generated code before deployment
- **Use latest stable version:** Install from `^1.0.0` (semantic versioning)
- **Sanitize user inputs:** If using code generation with user-provided templates
- **Run security audits:** `npm audit` before production deployments
- **Use HTTPS for API calls:** If code generation uses external AI services
- **Limit file system access:** Run code generation in sandboxed environments when possible

### ❌ DON'T
- **Execute generated code blindly:** Always review before running
- **Expose API keys in templates:** Use environment variables for secrets
- **Trust unvalidated templates:** Validate template sources before use
- **Run as root/admin:** Use least-privilege principles
- **Store credentials in generated code:** Use secure credential management

---

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Code Generation Risks
AI-generated code may not always follow security best practices. **Always review generated code** for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) risks
- Path traversal issues
- Insecure deserialization
- Hardcoded credentials

### 2. Template Injection
If using custom templates with user input:
- Validate and sanitize all template variables
- Use a sandbox for template rendering
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for web outputs

### 3. File System Access
Code generation may write to the file system:
- Restrict output directories with proper permissions
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Use allowlists for permitted output locations

### 4. Dependency Chain
`@dcyfr/ai-code-gen` depends on:
- `ts-morph` - TypeScript AST manipulation
- `handlebars` - Template engine
- `chalk` - Terminal styling (dev only)

We actively monitor these dependencies for vulnerabilities.
